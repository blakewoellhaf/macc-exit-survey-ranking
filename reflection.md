Alot changed from Project 1 to this mini assignment. In Project 1 we relied heavily on a chat bot to create all outputs and answer all questions. While convienient, it was frustrating at time when you could not get the bot to do what you want. In this assignment, we still relied on a bot, but it did not require as much guidance. 
The control is now in the code, rather than in the chatbot. 
If I had one more week, I think I would create an actual website out of this and add much more detail. I would also clean up the graphic and create a visual that shows more of the story. 
Workflows like this would be very useful in courses like accounting data analytics. Being able to filter through large datasets quickly would speed things up tremendously.
